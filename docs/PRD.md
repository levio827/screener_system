### 6.5 Caching Strategy

#### Cache Layers

**1. Browser Cache**
- Static assets (JS, CSS, images): 1 year TTL
- Service Worker for offline support (optional Phase 3)

**2. CDN Cache (CloudFlare)**
- Static assets: Edge caching
- API responses: Cache-Control headers for public data

**3. Application Cache (Redis)**

| Data Type | Key Pattern | TTL | Update Trigger |
|-----------|-------------|-----|----------------|
| Hot stocks | `hot_stocks:realtime` | 5 min | Scheduled job every 5 min |
| Stock detail | `stock:{code}:detail` | 1 hour | Daily data pipeline |
| Stock prices (recent) | `stock:{code}:prices:1y` | 1 hour | Daily data pipeline |
| Screening results | `screen:{filter_hash}` | 10 min | Calculated on-demand |
| Market overview | `market:overview` | 5 min | Scheduled job every 5 min |
| User session | `session:{user_id}` | 15 min | Token refresh |
| Indicators (all stocks) | `indicators:all:{date}` | 24 hours | Daily calculation |

**4. Database Query Cache**
- PostgreSQL shared_buffers: 25% of RAM
- Materialized views for common aggregations

#### Cache Invalidation

```python
# Example: Invalidate cache on data update
@celery.task
def update_daily_prices():
    # 1. Fetch new prices from KRX
    new_prices = krx_api.get_daily_prices()

    # 2. Update database
    db.bulk_insert(new_prices)

    # 3. Invalidate relevant caches
    for stock_code in new_prices:
        redis.delete(f"stock:{stock_code}:detail")
        redis.delete(f"stock:{stock_code}:prices:*")

    # 4. Update calculated indicators
    recalculate_indicators.delay()
```

---

### 6.6 Security Architecture

#### Authentication Flow

```
1. User Login
   → Client sends { email, password } to /auth/login
   → Server validates credentials
   → Server generates JWT access token (15 min expiry)
   → Server generates refresh token (30 days expiry, stored in DB)
   → Server returns both tokens

2. Authenticated Request
   → Client includes: Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
   → API Gateway validates JWT signature + expiry
   → If valid, request proceeds to API server
   → If expired, client must refresh

3. Token Refresh
   → Client sends refresh token to /auth/refresh
   → Server validates refresh token (check DB, not revoked)
   → Server issues new access token
   → Client stores new access token

4. Logout
   → Client sends request to /auth/logout
   → Server revokes refresh token (add to blacklist)
   → Client discards tokens
```

#### Security Measures

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|
| **SQL Injection** | Parameterized queries via SQLAlchemy ORM |
| **XSS** | CSP headers, sanitize user inputs, escape outputs |
| **CSRF** | SameSite cookies, CSRF tokens for state-changing ops |
| **Brute Force** | Rate limiting (5 failed logins → 15 min lockout) |
| **DDoS** | CloudFlare protection, rate limiting per IP |
| **Data Breach** | Encrypt PII at rest (AES-256), TLS 1.3 in transit |
| **Dependency Vulnerabilities** | Weekly Dependabot scans, automated updates |
| **API Abuse** | Rate limiting (100 req/min per user, 1000/min per IP) |

### 6.7 Documentation Infrastructure

#### Unified Documentation Platform

To ensure comprehensive, accessible, and maintainable documentation for all stakeholders (developers, users, QA, and business teams), we will implement a unified documentation platform that consolidates all project documentation.

**Documentation Platform**: Docusaurus (React-based)

**Rationale**:
- **Modern & Interactive**: React-based with MDX support for interactive components
- **Multi-language Support**: Integrates with Python (Sphinx) and TypeScript (TypeDoc) auto-documentation
- **Developer-friendly**: Markdown-based authoring with hot reload
- **Search & Navigation**: Built-in search with Algolia DocSearch integration
- **Versioning**: Support for multiple documentation versions
- **Deployment**: Simple deployment to GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify with CDN

#### Documentation Structure

```

#### Auto-Documentation Integration

| Component | Tool | Source | Output |
|-----------|------|--------|--------|
| **Python Backend** | Sphinx + autodoc | Docstrings in `.py` files | API reference HTML |
| **TypeScript Frontend** | TypeDoc | TSDoc comments in `.ts/.tsx` | Component docs |
| **REST API** | FastAPI | OpenAPI spec | Interactive API docs |
| **Database** | SchemaSpy | PostgreSQL schema | ER diagrams, table docs |

#### Documentation Standards

**Python Docstrings** (Google Style):
```python
def get_stock_by_code(stock_code: str) -> StockDetail:
    """
    Get stock detail by code with caching.

    Args:
        stock_code: 6-digit stock code (e.g., "005930").

    Returns:
        StockDetail with latest price and indicators.

    Raises:
        NotFoundException: If stock not found.

    Example:
        >>> detail = service.get_stock_by_code("005930")
        >>> print(f"{detail.name}: {detail.latest_price.close_price:,} KRW")
        Samsung Electronics: 71,000 KRW
    """
```

**TypeScript TSDoc**:
```typescript
/**
 * Stock screening table with advanced filtering.
 *
 * @param props - Component props
 * @param props.filters - Active screening filters
 * @param props.onStockSelect - Callback when stock selected
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * <StockScreener
 *   filters={{ market: 'KOSPI', per: { max: 20 } }}
 *   onStockSelect={(stock) => navigate(`/stocks/${stock.code}`)}
 * />
 * ```
 */
export const StockScreener: React.FC<Props> = ({ filters, onStockSelect }) => {
  // Implementation
};
```

#### CI/CD Integration

Documentation will be automatically built and deployed on every commit:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/docs.yml
on:
  pull_request:
    paths: ['docs/**', 'frontend/src/**', 'backend/app/**']
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build:

## 12. Appendices

### Appendix A: Glossary of Financial Terms

**PER (Price-to-Earnings Ratio)**
- Definition: Current stock price divided by earnings per share (EPS)
- Formula: Stock Price / EPS
- Interpretation: Lower PER may indicate undervaluation, but varies by industry

**PBR (Price-to-Book Ratio)**
- Definition: Market capitalization divided by book value of equity
- Formula: Market Cap / Total Equity
- Interpretation: PBR < 1 suggests stock trades below book value

**ROE (Return on Equity)**
- Definition: Profitability relative to shareholders' equity
- Formula: Net Income / Shareholders' Equity × 100%
- Interpretation: Higher ROE indicates efficient use of equity capital

**Free Cash Flow (FCF)**
- Definition: Cash generated after capital expenditures
- Formula: Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures
- Interpretation: Positive FCF indicates cash available for dividends, buybacks, or reinvestment

---

### Appendix D: Technical Debt & Future Refactoring

**Known Technical Debt**:
1. **Monolithic API**: Consider microservices architecture in Phase 4 for better scalability

4. **Session storage in Redis**: Migrate to dedicated session store if scale demands it

**Future Optimizations**:
- Implement GraphQL for more flexible API queries (reduce over-fetching)
- Edge computing for real-time price updates (reduce latency)
- Machine learning for anomaly detection in financial data
- Blockchain-based audit trail for data integrity
