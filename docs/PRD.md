### 6.5 Caching Strategy

#### Cache Layers

**1. Browser Cache**
- Static assets (JS, CSS, images): 1 year TTL
- Service Worker for offline support (optional Phase 3)

**2. CDN Cache (CloudFlare)**
- Static assets: Edge caching
- API responses: Cache-Control headers for public data

**3. Application Cache (Redis)**

| Data Type | Key Pattern | TTL | Update Trigger |
|-----------|-------------|-----|----------------|
| Hot stocks | `hot_stocks:realtime` | 5 min | Scheduled job every 5 min |
| Stock detail | `stock:{code}:detail` | 1 hour | Daily data pipeline |
| Stock prices (recent) | `stock:{code}:prices:1y` | 1 hour | Daily data pipeline |
| Screening results | `screen:{filter_hash}` | 10 min | Calculated on-demand |
| Market overview | `market:overview` | 5 min | Scheduled job every 5 min |
| User session | `session:{user_id}` | 15 min | Token refresh |
| Indicators (all stocks) | `indicators:all:{date}` | 24 hours | Daily calculation |

**4. Database Query Cache**
- PostgreSQL shared_buffers: 25% of RAM
- Materialized views for common aggregations

#### Cache Invalidation

```python
# Example: Invalidate cache on data update
@celery.task
def update_daily_prices():
    # 1. Fetch new prices from KRX
    new_prices = krx_api.get_daily_prices()

    # 2. Update database
    db.bulk_insert(new_prices)

    # 3. Invalidate relevant caches
    for stock_code in new_prices:
        redis.delete(f"stock:{stock_code}:detail")
        redis.delete(f"stock:{stock_code}:prices:*")

    # 4. Update calculated indicators
    recalculate_indicators.delay()
```

---

### 6.6 Security Architecture

#### Authentication Flow

```
1. User Login
   → Client sends { email, password } to /auth/login
   → Server validates credentials
   → Server generates JWT access token (15 min expiry)
   → Server generates refresh token (30 days expiry, stored in DB)
   → Server returns both tokens

2. Authenticated Request
   → Client includes: Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
   → API Gateway validates JWT signature + expiry
   → If valid, request proceeds to API server
   → If expired, client must refresh

3. Token Refresh
   → Client sends refresh token to /auth/refresh
   → Server validates refresh token (check DB, not revoked)
   → Server issues new access token
   → Client stores new access token

4. Logout
   → Client sends request to /auth/logout
   → Server revokes refresh token (add to blacklist)
   → Client discards tokens
```

#### Security Measures

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|
| **SQL Injection** | Parameterized queries via SQLAlchemy ORM |
| **XSS** | CSP headers, sanitize user inputs, escape outputs |
| **CSRF** | SameSite cookies, CSRF tokens for state-changing ops |
| **Brute Force** | Rate limiting (5 failed logins → 15 min lockout) |
| **DDoS** | CloudFlare protection, rate limiting per IP |
| **Data Breach** | Encrypt PII at rest (AES-256), TLS 1.3 in transit |
| **Dependency Vulnerabilities** | Weekly Dependabot scans, automated updates |
| **API Abuse** | Rate limiting (100 req/min per user, 1000/min per IP) |

### Appendix D: Technical Debt & Future Refactoring

**Known Technical Debt**:
