```

**Test Scenario 2: Daily Limit Enforcement**
```gherkin
Given I am an anonymous user
And I have performed 10 screenings today
When I attempt an 11th screening
Then I see a "Daily Limit Reached" modal
And the modal shows my usage (11/10)
And the modal shows reset time (tomorrow midnight)

Then I am navigated to signup page with context
And after signup, I have unlimited searches
```

**Test Scenario 3: SEO & Social Sharing**
```gherkin
Given I am Googlebot crawling stock pages
When I fetch /stock/005930
Then I see server-rendered HTML
And Open Graph meta tags are present
