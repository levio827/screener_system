| **User Retention (30d)** | 40% | N/A | 🔄 Pending |
| **Avg Session Duration** | 8+ min | N/A | 🔄 Pending |
| **Screening Performance** | < 500ms | 280ms ✅ | ✅ Met |

**Infrastructure Ready**: ✅ System can support growth to 50K users

### 7.3 ROI and Cost Analysis

**Development Cost**:
- 304 hours × $100/hr (blended rate) = **$30,400**
- Infrastructure: $500/month (estimated)

**Expected Revenue** (Year 1):
- Free tier: 40,000 users (80% of 50K target)
- Basic tier ($10/mo): 8,000 users (16%)
- Pro tier ($30/mo): 2,000 users (4%)
- **Annual Revenue**: $0 + $960K + $720K = **$1.68M ARR**

**ROI**: ($1.68M - $36.4K) / $36.4K = **4,514% ROI** (highly favorable)

**Note**: Revenue projections pending launch and user acquisition.
