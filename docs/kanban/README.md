1. **Limit WIP**: Maximum 2 tickets in "In Progress" per person
2. **Update Progress**: Update progress percentage daily
3. **Blocked Tickets**: Add "BLOCKED" label and note blocker
4. **Review Time**: Aim for < 24 hour review turnaround
5. **Definition of Done**:
   - All subtasks completed ✓
   - All acceptance criteria met ✓
   - Tests passing ✓
   - Code reviewed ✓
   - Deployed to staging ✓

## Metrics

Track these metrics weekly:

- **Velocity**: Tickets completed per sprint
- **Cycle Time**: Average time from todo → done
- **Lead Time**: Average time from backlog → done
- **WIP**: Current work in progress count
- **Blocked**: Number of blocked tickets

## Sprint Planning

Before each sprint:

1. Review completed tickets
2. Calculate velocity
3. Prioritize backlog
4. Move tickets to todo (based on velocity)
5. Assign tickets to team members
6. Update sprint goals

## Daily Standup

Each team member answers:

1. What did I complete yesterday?
2. What am I working on today?
3. Am I blocked? (If yes, move ticket and add note)
