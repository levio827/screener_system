## Progress
- **100%** - Implementation complete

## Implementation Summary

### Completed Components

**Phase 1: Prometheus Setup** ✅
- Updated `prometheus.yml` with retention policy (15 days)
- Configured scraping for backend, postgres, redis, nginx, celery, airflow
- Docker Compose integration with data persistence

**Phase 2: Backend Metrics Instrumentation** ✅
- Created `app/core/metrics.py` with comprehensive metrics:
  - HTTP: requests, duration, errors, in-progress
  - Database: query duration, connections, slow queries
  - Cache: hit ratio, operations, memory usage
  - Business: users, screenings, portfolios, websockets
- Implemented `app/middleware/metrics.py` for automatic HTTP tracking
- Added `/metrics` endpoint for Prometheus scraping
- Integrated middleware into `app/main.py`

**Phase 3: Grafana Dashboards** ✅
- Created 4 production-ready dashboards:
  - `api_performance.json`: Request rate, latency (p50/p95/p99), errors, top endpoints
  - `database_performance.json`: Query duration, connections, slow queries
  - `cache_performance.json`: Hit rate, operations, latency, memory
  - `business_metrics.json`: Active users, registrations, screenings
- Updated `dashboard.yml` for automatic provisioning
- Configured datasource connection to Prometheus

**Phase 4: Docker Compose Integration** ✅
- Added retention policy to Prometheus (`--storage.tsdb.retention.time=15d`)
- Configured Grafana dashboard volume mounts
- Monitoring services accessible via `--profile monitoring`

**Phase 5: Documentation** ✅
- Created comprehensive `backend/docs/MONITORING.md`:
  - Quick start guide
  - Available metrics and example queries
  - Dashboard descriptions
  - Custom metric instrumentation guide
  - Alerting setup
  - Troubleshooting
  - Production considerations

## Test Results

**Syntax Validation**: ✅ All Python files pass syntax check
```bash
python3 -m py_compile app/core/metrics.py app/middleware/metrics.py
# ✓ Python syntax check passed

- ✅ `backend/app/middleware/metrics.py` (new, 197 lines)
- ✅ `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/health.py` (modified, +/metrics endpoint)
- ✅ `backend/app/main.py` (modified, +PrometheusMetricsMiddleware)
- ✅ `backend/docs/MONITORING.md` (new, 450 lines)
- ✅ `infrastructure/monitoring/prometheus/prometheus.yml` (modified)

- ✅ `infrastructure/monitoring/grafana/dashboards/json/api_performance.json` (new)
- ✅ `infrastructure/monitoring/grafana/dashboards/json/database_performance.json` (new)
- ✅ `infrastructure/monitoring/grafana/dashboards/json/cache_performance.json` (new)
- ✅ `infrastructure/monitoring/grafana/dashboards/json/business_metrics.json` (new)
- ✅ `docker-compose.yml` (modified, +retention policy, +dashboard mounts)

## Notes
- Start with simple dashboards, iterate based on needs
- Alert fatigue: only alert on actionable issues
- Use service-level indicators (SLIs) and objectives (SLOs)
- Consider cost when choosing managed services vs self-hosted
- Retention balance: storage cost vs historical data value
