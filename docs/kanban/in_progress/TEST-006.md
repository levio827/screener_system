**Created**: 2025-11-16
**Started**: 2025-11-17

## Description

Implement tests for health check endpoints. These endpoints are critical for monitoring, container orchestration (Docker health checks), and load balancer health probes.

## Current Status

- **Test File**: `backend/tests/api/test_health.py` ✅ **CREATED**
- **Test Count**: 19 comprehensive integration tests
- **Test Classes**:
  - `TestBasicHealthCheck` (3 tests)
  - `TestDatabaseHealthCheck` (4 tests)
  - `TestRedisHealthCheck` (6 tests)
  - `TestMetricsEndpoint` (3 tests)
  - `TestHealthCheckPerformance` (2 tests)
- **Endpoints Covered**:
  - ✅ `GET /api/v1/health` (basic health check)
  - ✅ `GET /api/v1/health/db` (database health)
  - ✅ `GET /api/v1/health/redis` (Redis health)
  - ✅ `GET /api/v1/metrics` (Prometheus metrics)
- **Note**: `/health/detailed` endpoint is not implemented in source code, so not tested

## Test Requirements

### 1. Basic Health Check (0.25h)

```python
def test_health_endpoint():
    """Test GET /health returns 200 OK"""

def test_health_endpoint_no_auth_required():
    """Test health endpoint accessible without authentication"""

def test_health_endpoint_response_format():
    """Test response includes status and timestamp"""
```

### 2. Database Health Check (0.25h)

```python
def test_health_db_connected():
    """Test /health/db returns 200 when database connected"""

def test_health_db_disconnected():
    """Test /health/db returns 503 when database unreachable"""

def test_health_db_response_includes_details():
    """Test response includes database connection details"""
```

### 3. Redis Health Check (0.25h)

```python
def test_health_redis_connected():
    """Test /health/redis returns 200 when Redis connected"""

def test_health_redis_disconnected():
    """Test /health/redis returns 503 when Redis unreachable"""

def test_health_redis_response_includes_details():
    """Test response includes Redis connection details"""
```

### 4. Detailed Health Check (0.25h)

```python
def test_health_detailed_all_services_up():
    """Test /health/detailed when all services healthy"""

def test_health_detailed_partial_failure():
    """Test /health/detailed when some services down"""

def test_health_detailed_response_structure():
    """Test detailed health response includes all components"""

def test_health_detailed_performance_metrics():
    """Test response includes performance metrics (uptime, etc.)"""
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All health check endpoints tested (4 endpoints: /health, /health/db, /health/redis, /metrics)
- [x] Success cases tested (all services healthy)
- [x] Failure cases tested (services unavailable via mocking)
- [x] Response formats validated
- [x] No authentication required for health checks
- [x] HTTP status codes correct (200 for both healthy and unhealthy with status field)
- [x] Performance tests added (response time <100ms for /health, <200ms for /health/db)
- [ ] Test coverage for health endpoints reaches >95% (pending CI/CD verification)
- [ ] All tests pass in CI/CD pipeline (pending PR merge)

## Dependencies

- pytest
- FastAPI TestClient
- Mock database and Redis connections for failure scenarios

## Testing Strategy

1. **Integration Tests**: Test actual health check logic
2. **Mock Failures**: Simulate database/Redis connection failures
3. **Response Validation**: Verify response schemas and status codes
4. **Performance Tests**: Verify health checks respond quickly (<100ms)

## Related Files

- Source: `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/health.py`
- Test: `backend/tests/api/test_health.py` (to be created)
- Dependencies: `backend/app/core/dependencies.py`

## Notes

- Health checks should not require authentication (for load balancers)
- Test with mocked database/Redis failures
- Verify response times are fast (health checks should be lightweight)
- Include test for Docker health check command
- Consider Kubernetes liveness/readiness probe formats

## Docker Health Check

Verify health endpoint works with Docker health check:
```dockerfile
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --retries=3 \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:8000/health || exit 1
```
